          <h1><strong><em>What</em></strong></h1>
          <p>
            Robotics is a technological field that provides products that reduce man-hours required
            to perform a task, that reduce human risk in hazardous environments, and that reduces economic 
            cost per task but currently provides a lower level of reliability than alternatives. 
            The proper working of robotic systems often involves sensors, embedded processors, actuators, 
            and communication devices for reactive control and/or data analysis.

          <h1><strong><em>Why</em></strong></h1>
          <p>
            Exploration of areas with known or unknown hazards is made possible with robotic systems. 
            Human knowledge itself is advanced through the exploration of our world 
            as well as our solar system and beyond. This is a noble pursuit. Robots are becoming an increasingly 
            important aspect of exploration as well as the related search and rescue field.

          <h1><strong><em>How</em></strong></h1>
          <p>
            Most innovative advances in robotics today are performed by Academia. Professors with government 
            and industry clients produce products and/or test theories. Robotic startups contribute 
            to the innovation in the field but have more difficulty acquiring funding and are made up of small
            groups in localized areas.
